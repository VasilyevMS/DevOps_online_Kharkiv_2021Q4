DevOps is not only a person who works in a team. Itâ€™s the strategy of collaboration of all employees who provide a product through all stages: planning, developing, testing, deploying, supporting, etc. But the kicker is that DevOps approach allows the team to work more productively, quicker & with higher quality.

When doing the task1.1 a few branches were added. A web page index.html was made with a few images using a simple template of CSS styles. The main result of this issue is understanding of logic operations. So develop branch is for the creation of a web page, the images branch is for work with pictures, and the styles branch is for the work with styles of our page.
